# Introduction

It consist of [Dashboard](https://app.verify-u.com) for your business account management, a customizable [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)-based gateway for identification processing and a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for data extraction. 

### Identification Demo <a name="identification-demo"></a>

Explore our [Fintech Bank demo](http://demo.verify-u.com/) to see how easy it is to set up a custom identification page using OAuth 2.0 libraries. The demo illustrates how to onboard clients using both [selfID](https://www.verify-u.com/verify-u-selfid) and [f2f](https://www.verify-u.com/verify-u-f2f) products on the web. 

<div class="alert">
    f2f requires a live agent to process an identification and the demo store is monitored for clients only on scheduled basis. Please contact sales to book an appointment.

<!-- selfID is an automatic identification is a fully automated identification flow used to identify a physical person.
It consists of three steps:

- Identification document upload (passport, driver's license, ID card) for picture and data extraction
- Face detection for identification document photo comparison
- Liveness detection for confirmation of client's presence

This method of identification is best used for onboarding scenarios where simplified due diligence
can be used. -->
