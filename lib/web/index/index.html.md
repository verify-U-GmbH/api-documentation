### Automatic identification <a name="automatic-identification"></a>

Automatic identification is a fully automated identification flow used to identify a physical person.
It consists of three steps:

- Identification document upload (passport, driver's license, ID card) for picture and data extraction
- Face detection for identification document photo comparison
- Liveness detection for confirmation of client's presence

This method of identification is best used for onboarding scenarios where simplified due diligence
can be used.
